## Installation
This app uses Node, Express,  MongoDB, React, and Cypress. Make sure to do an npm install to get access to all of the necessary node modules as well as create your own gitignore. You will also need to create you're own environment folder for your own MONGODB_URI.

## Usage
When first opening up the app you are presented with a start button. Simply press it to get started with your quiz. You will be presented with a total of ten questions with multiple choice options. Clicking on the button of the answer you believe to be correct will present you with the next question until you have answered all of the questions.

## Tests
This app uses Cypress to do both Component testing and end to end(e2e) testing. To do this, first do an npm run build, npm seed, and npm run start:dev. Then in a seperate terminal you can do an npm run cypress to run the test in their electron app or one of their other browsers. Alternatively, you can do an npm run test and have both the component test and e2e test done right in the terminal for quicker results. You can check out an example video of this in action below.
